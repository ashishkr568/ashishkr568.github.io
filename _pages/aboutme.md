**Welcome, people from the digital world !!**{: .x-large} 

This is Ashish. I am a Data Scientist with experience in providing insightful data-driven solutions to customers in multiple domains such as energy, media, networking, healthcare and construction.  These end to end solutions includes data mining, ETL tasks, data exploration/visualization, predictive modelling (using statistical methods and machine learning algorithms), model deployment and its maintenance/retraining.

I am someone who likes to get their hands dirty building stuff rather than spending several years learning abstract concepts.

I earned my Bachelor of Technology(BTech) degree in Electrical Engineering in 2011 from  [Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University, Lucknow, India](https://aktu.ac.in/) (formerly Uttar Pradesh Technical University).

I am an avid traveller who loves to go on long drives, explore places/cultures, go for hikes/treks and sometimes cook good Indian cuisine. Being a proud dog father, I also love travelling and playing with my pup Tyson.

I have created this website to:
- help a 10 year younger version of myself, by writing blogs which included sharing some of the technical challenges I faced and some of my life experiences.
 - share details of the projects I have worked on either to make my life simpler or to help me grow technically.
 - improve my writing skills.
 - receive constructive feedback.
