This is the source code of my personal site https://ashishkr568.github.io/. It's built using the [Jekyll]. I used the [Minimal Mistakes][mmistakes-template] template from [Michael Rose][mmistakes-web] and few changes from [Luis Puerto][luis-puerto] as a base and I've added some changes from my _own vintage_. Please feel free to fork my work since I would really happy to see that it helps others to build also their sites.

## Getting Started

You can get a copy of this repo running the following in your terminal: 

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ashishkr568/ashishkr568.github.io.git
```

### Prerequisites

The only prerequisite to run this blog locally is to have Jekyll on your machine, and it's recommended to have also [Bundler][]. 

```shell
$ gem install jekyll bundler
```

Of course to be able to run Jekyll you need to have several other things on your system, like Ruby :gem:. Please check the [Jekyll docs][JekyllDocs] for more info about prerequisites. 

## Built With

This site is build using the following software and services. 

- [Jekyll][] - The static website generator I'm using to build my side. 
- [Bundler][] - Bundler manages an application's dependencies through its entire life, across many machines, systematically and repeatably. 
- [Minimal Mistakes][mmistakes-template] - The Jekyll template I'm using. 
- [GitHub](https://github.com) - Where I'm building and hosting my site. 
- [TravisCI][] - I'm performing some continuous integration tasks over here, like for example index the site for [Algolia][] when I build it from main.  

### Icons + Demo Images:
Some of the icons and images come from the following sites:

- [The Noun Project][TheNounProject] - Icons for everything. 
- [Font Awesome][FontAwesome] - Vector icons and social logos.
- [Unsplash][] - Free images.
