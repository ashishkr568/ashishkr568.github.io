<br> It doesn't matter what software and libraries we learn because it only takes a few days to switch from one software or library to another. Whatever tools we use the concept remains the same. These libraries will be updated at a much faster pace in the coming time as more people will be getting into this field, with different skillsets and ideas and will be trying out different things. So, with these scenarios, whatever libraries and software we use, will be obsolete in a year or two.

So, the focus on learning should be on understanding the underlying concepts and how to apply them and how to build expertise in new tools and techniques that are released.

*Keep Learning..!!*
